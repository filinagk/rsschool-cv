## Summary

I started a career working as a graphic designer, also I use to work as a school teacher and operation/sales manager in language learning centre. Now I've desided to build a new career in IT field

I always enjoyed complicated and challenging tasks, witch makes me look deeply, pay attention to the detales, but also stay creative working on them. That is exacetly what I found in programming, when started to learn JavaScript syntax.

<p>
Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.

```
var countSheep = function (num) {
  let murmur = '';
  
  for (let currentSheepNum = 1; currentSheepNum <= num; currentSheepNum++) {
    murmur += currentSheepNum + ' sheep...';
  }

  return murmur;
}
```
