## Summary

I started my career as a graphic designer, also I used to work as a school teacher and operation/sales manager in language learning centre. Now I've decided to build a new career in the IT field, because it has wide circle of opportunities for professional growing and self-development.

I always enjoyed complicated and challenging tasks, which makes me look deeply, pay attention to the details, but also stay creative working on them. This is exactly what I found in programming, when had started learning JavaScript.

I study a lot by attending courses and by myself as well, so I belive that my willing to learn, to grow professionaly and to try new things will help me to gain crucial programming skills and become proficient Frontend Developer.

## Code example

<details><summary><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077">Sheep counter</a></summary>
<p>
Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.

```
var countSheep = function (num) {
  let murmur = '';
  
  for (let currentSheepNum = 1; currentSheepNum <= num; currentSheepNum++) {
    murmur += currentSheepNum + ' sheep...';
  }

  return murmur;
}
```
</p>
</details>


<details><summary><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/58649884a1659ed6cb000072">Traffic lights switch</a></summary>
<p>

You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

```
function updateLight(current) {
  switch (current) {
      case 'green':
      return 'yellow';
      case 'yellow':
      return 'red';
      case 'red':
      return 'green';
  }
};
```
