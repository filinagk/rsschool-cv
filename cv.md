## Summary

I started a career working as a graphic designer, also I use to work as a school teacher and operation/sales manager in language learning centre. Now I've desided to build a new career in IT field

I always enjoyed complicated and challenging tasks, witch makes me look deeply, pay attention to the detales, but also stay creative working on them. That is exacetly what I found in programming, when started to learn JavaScript syntax.
