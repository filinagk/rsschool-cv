    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I started my career as a graphic designer, also I used to work as a school teacher and operation/sales manager in
        language learning centre. Now I've decided to build a new career in the IT field, because it has wide circle of

        professionaly and to try new things will help me to gain crucial programming skills and become proficient
