    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I started my career as a graphic designer, also I used to work as a school teacher and operation/sales manager in
        language learning centre. Now I've decided to build a new career in the IT field, because it has wide circle of
        opportunities for professional growing and self-development.</p>
    <p>I always enjoyed complicated and challenging tasks, which makes me look deeply, pay attention to the details, but
        also stay creative working on them. This is exactly what I found in programming, when had started learning
        JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I study a lot by attending courses and by myself as well, so I belive that my willing to learn, to grow
        professionaly and to try new things will help me to gain crucial programming skills and become proficient
        Frontend Developer.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Git/Github</li>
        <li>Figma</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Code example</h2>

    <p>Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...".
        Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.</p>
    <code>
        <pre>
      var countSheep = function (num) {
      let murmur = '';
      
      for (let currentSheepNum = 1; currentSheepNum &lt;= num; currentSheepNum++) { 
        murmur +=currentSheepNum + ' sheep...'; 
         }
        return murmur; 
        }
        </pre>
        </code>

    <p>You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green,
        to yellow, to red, and then to green again.</p>

    <p>Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns
        a string representing the state the light should change to.</p>

    <p>For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.</p>

    <code>
        <pre>
        function updateLight(current) {
          switch (current) {
          case 'green':
          return 'yellow';
          case 'yellow':
          return 'red';
          case 'red':
          return 'green';
            }
          };
        </pre>
    </code>
