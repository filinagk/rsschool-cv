    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I started my career as a graphic designer, also I used to work as a school teacher and operation/sales manager in
        language learning centre. Now I've decided to build a new career in the IT field, because it has wide circle of
        opportunities for professional growing and self-development.</p>

        also stay creative working on them. This is exactly what I found in programming, when had started learning

    <p>I study a lot by attending courses and by myself as well, so I belive that my willing to learn, to grow
        professionaly and to try new things will help me to gain crucial programming skills and become proficient
        Frontend Developer.</p>
